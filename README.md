# SearchOfChoice
Search of choice has 3 main pages
* /create - The place where you create the links.
* /engineselect - The place where you can change your engine of choice
* / - The place where you visit links.
As simple as that.

The program gives the user a choice of what search engine they like once a year, and when they recieve a link to SearchOfChoice they will automatically redirect to their favorite search engines.
